* Fitting an Ellipse to a Set of Data Points

This python program fits an ellipse through a given set of points.
This ellips is optimal in the least squares sense.

- The code is documented in =fitEllipse.org= from which I made =fitEllipse.pdf= and the python source files (with tangling).
-  =fitEllipse.py= contains the algorithm.
- =fit_ellipse_example.py= shows an example on how to use the code
- =run_fit_ellipse.py= makes many test cases.


Before moving this code to github, it was available at http://nicky.vanforeest.com/misc/fitEllipse/fitEllipse.html.
