Fitting an Ellipse to a Set of Data Points
===============================================

This python program fits an ellipse through a given set of points.
This ellips is optimal in the least squares sense.

The code is documented in ``fitEllipse.pdf``.

I use pythontex to make the pdf from the latex file (first pdflatex,
then pythontex, then pdflatex again). See the docs of pythontex. BTW,
pythotex is really useful. I use it all the time.

The source of the code can be found in ``fitEllipse.tex``.
